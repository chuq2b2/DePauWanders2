                    Nepal, officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, is a landlocked country in South Asia.
                    It is mainly situated in the Himalayas, but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, 
                    bordering the Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north, and India in the south, east, and west, 
                    while it is narrowly separated from Bangladesh by the Siliguri Corridor, and from Bhutan by the Indian
                     state of Sikkim.

                <p>Gundruk is regarded as the national dish of Nepal.
                     It is an assortment of pickled green-leafy vegetables which is relished as a condiment
                      or a side dish with the main course meal. Mustard, radish, and cauliflower are wilted 
                      for a day or two and then stored in a tight earthenware pot which allows the leaves to
                       release acidic juices. So, it is basically a Nepali kimchi.</p>

                        of the gods over a host of demons, based on tales in the Ramayana, after invoking the powers 
                        of the goddess Durga. Tantric rites are conducted as mother goddess temple offerings are made
                         and specific rituals take place in all homes, towns and cities every day of the event.</p>

                         day is known as 'dogs' day' and every four legged friend is adorned with a floral garland,
                          given a delicious meal and worshipped for its protection of the home. Cows are given
                           similar treatment on the third day, as representatives of wealth.
