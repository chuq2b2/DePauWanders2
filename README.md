University Culture Website
This website is designed to help the university community broaden its understanding of different cultures from around the world. 
The website includes three main pages: Home, Map, and Timeline. The Map page utilizes D3 and csv to store and display data in an svg map, 
while the Timeline page displays a chronological list of cultural events.

Home Page
The Home page is the landing page of the website. 
It provides an overview of the website's purpose and introduces the two main features, 
the Map and Timeline pages. Visitors to the website can navigate to these pages directly from the Home page.

Map Page
The Map page is where users can explore the cultures of different countries on an interactive map. 
The map is powered by D3 and displays cultural data in an svg map. 
Users can select a country from the map, and the map will display cultural data for that specific country.
The cultural data is stored in a csv file, which is read by the website and displayed in the svg map. 
The csv file can be easily updated to add new cultural data or modify existing data.

Timeline Page
The Timeline page displays a chronological list of cultural events from different countries. 
The events are sorted and displayed in the order they occurred, with the most recent event at the top of the list.
The cultural events are stored in a csv file, which is read by the website and displayed in the timeline. 
Users can add new events to the csv file to keep the timeline up-to-date.

Getting Started
To get started with this website, simply navigate to the Home page and explore the Map and Timeline pages. 
You can select a country from the Map page to learn about its culture or scroll through the Timeline page to view past cultural events.

If you would like to update the cultural data in the Map or Timeline pages, you can modify the corresponding csv files. 
Simply add new data to the file or modify existing data, and the website will automatically update to display the changes.
