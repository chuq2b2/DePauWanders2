            <h2>What problems are we encounting at DePauw University?</h2>
            <div class="section">
                <ol>
                    <li>Limited understanding of diverse cultural perspectives and practices</li>
                        <p>At DePauw University, a dynamic academic community with a strong emphasis on cultivating 
                            global citizens, intercultural exchange is highly valued. The campus is open to students
                            from across the United States and around the globe, and currently hosts over 270 international 
                            and exchange students from more than 30 countries, comprising nearly 18% of the student population. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            However, with that high population of international students, it proposes an issue of how to
                            get to know and understand the essence of each different cultures. With many cultural organizations,
                            it's difficult to nagivate all of the cultural events happening on campus. Furthermore, each culture has specific
                            restrictions for cuisines, religious backgrounds, and historical figures. It's essential for DePauw University
                            students to be educated in order to fully understand and have a basic understanding of cultures from all around 
                            the world. 
                    
                        </p>
                    <li>How can we navigate all cultural events happening over the world and celebrate it at DePauw?</li>
                        <p>
                            With the above problem, another issue propose how the students at DePauw can have a concrete foundation
                            of what is going on around the world and what events are being celebrated at our institutions.
